          One of the activities I learned about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Reference Models. A few key takeaways I learned throughout this activity were two key models that explain how data travels over networks. Starting off with the OSI Model (which has 7 layers), is a theoretical framework that breaks down networking into layers. These layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. What happens here is each layer handles a specific part of communication such as user applications or routing. Another model I learned about during this activity was the TCP/IP Model (which includes 4 layers), which is a practical model actually used on the Internet. These layers consist of Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. These models help us understand how different devices communicate, and how to troubleshoot issues by identifying where in the process data might fail. How I can apply these fundamentals moving forward, gives me a clear framework to understand how the Internet works from the ground up.

        The second activity I began reading about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Domain Name System. During this activity, I learned more about DNS, why it exists, and its structure. DNS stands for Domain Name System. DNS translates easy to remember domain names (like google.com) into numerical IP addresses. It exists simply because it translates domain names into a specific IP address so that the initiating client can load the requested Internet resources. It operates through a decentralized, hierarchical structure, from root servers down to authoritative servers. DNS makes web addresses comprehensible to humans, scalable for everyone’s use, and secure and protects communication and resource access across the web. As I start to explore different career paths, learning the internet fundamentals such as DNS can provide great insight as to how the web really works. It’s also great for more knowledge as a web developer which could be a path anyone would want to pursue.

        The last activity I wanted to learn about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Protocols. The activity article walks through the backbone of how the Internet communicates, starting with the Internet Protocol. It’s a connectionless, best-effort service responsible for routing packets across networks. I learned how basic internet communication works and that is IP handles packet delivery, TCP ensures reliability, and UDP prioritizes speed. The article also introduces common protocols like FTP for file transfers, Telnet for remote access, and HTTP for web browsing. Overall, it helped me understand the roles these protocols play in how data moves across networks. This gives me more background on how IPs work and how they are useful for networking or working on the backend.
