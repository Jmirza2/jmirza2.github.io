          One of the activities I learned about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Reference Models. A few key takeaways I learned throughout this activity were two key models that explain how data travels over networks. Starting off with the OSI Model (which has 7 layers), is a theoretical framework that breaks down networking into layers. These layers are: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. What happens here is each layer handles a specific part of communication such as user applications or routing. Another model I learned about during this activity was the TCP/IP Model (which includes 4 layers), which is a practical model actually used on the Internet. These layers consist of Link, Internet, Transport, and Application. These models help us understand how different devices communicate, and how to troubleshoot issues by identifying where in the process data might fail. How I can apply these fundamentals moving forward, gives me a clear framework to understand how the Internet works from the ground up.
