    <p> During this activity, I got to learn about what CSS is and how we use it during web development with HTML. CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets, used for styling a website. During this activity, I learned what Inline, Internal, and External mean. We use style for inline inside of HTML elements. We use the <style> element in the <head> section of our webpage, and lastly, we use the <link> element for external links to an external CSS file, which is what I used in my activity. I had a great time learning about the basics of CSS and applying what I learned to my HTML page, such as changing colors, fonts, and text sizes. I am torn on which course I should take next semester since I need one more course to graduate with Intro to Databases or Web Development. I would really love to take Web Development because it could help me a lot by creating my own webpages and could give me a boost in possibly becoming a frontend developer. HTML & CSS have been my favorite activities so far, just because I enjoy being creative and designing things to my liking. I do hope that in the future I pick up HTML, CSS, and JavaScript so I can begin designing my portfolio and possibly become a frontend developer in the future. </p>
