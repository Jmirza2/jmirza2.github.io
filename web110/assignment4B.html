      One of the activities I learned about was GCFLearnFree: Internet Safety. Throughout this activity, I learned the importance of having a cautious and informed mindset when using the internet. I realized just how important it is to be careful and intentional with how I use the internet. I learned how creating strong and unique passwords can really help protect my accounts, and that using a password manager makes it easier to stay secure without having to remember everything. I also got a better understanding of how browsers help keep us safe, like showing the little lock icon next to secure websites and blocking harmful pop-ups. One section that caught my eye was phishing. I now know to be more skeptical of strange emails or texts and to always double-check links before clicking. I also learned that downloading files from unknown sources is one of the main ways malware spreads onto your computer. The lesson on online shopping reminded me to only buy from trusted sites like Amazon or a more well-known company and always check for HTTPS before entering my payment info meaning it is a secure site. I also didn’t realize how much of my personal data can be tracked online, especially through cookies and social media, so I’m going to spend some time tightening my privacy settings. Overall, this activity gave me a clearer picture of how to protect myself online.

      The last activity I learned about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Security. During this activity, I got a clear picture of both the risks online and the tools we have to stay safe. This activity starts by showing how everything is connected online, and how easy it is for hackers to steal our data, and damage myself or a company's reputation. It also explained fundamental protocols like IPSec and SSL/TLS that secure our data as it moves across the internet. I was really amazed to see the threats section. Everything from mobile worms and ransomware to phishing scams and huge infrastructure attacks like Stuxnet. All of which shows how attackers work across different layers. Another cool and useful part was the breakdown of cookies: session, permanent, and third‑party, along with ways on how to delete or block them in different browsers. Overall, I really got a clear understanding of why layered defenses such as secure protocols, antivirus, firewalls, cautious browsing habits, and privacy controls are all needed. It was a great read for me to be more cautious while using the internet. This is also very useful information for someone who plans to pursue the cybersecurity path.
