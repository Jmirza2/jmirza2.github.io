      One of the activities I learned about was GCFLearnFree: Search Better. Search engines are essentially web-based tools used to find information on the internet. These search engines may be Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc, with Google being popular. The difference between different search engines is we get different results. For example, Google, the popular engine, usually provides more relevant results and organizes and filters those results better. What I learned during this activity was the different types of websites we might encounter when searching for information online. Each type serves a unique purpose and has strengths or weaknesses in terms of reliability, bias, and up to date content. For example, we have Commercial Sites, Organization Sites, Wiki, Blogs, and News Sites. Some new things I picked up on were different Cloud Bookmarkings such as Google Bookmarks, Diigo, and Instapaper. All offer different ways to bookmark, share, highlight, and comment on your bookmarks. Although I don’t use the features I listed, I am excited to learn more about how search engines operate in the next activity. Especially how different search engines provide different search results.

      The second activity I began reading about was TutorialsPoint: Search Engines. In this activity, we get the same explanation of a search engine with additional details on its components. What I learned about in this activity was the main functions of how search engines work. These are Crawling, Indexing, and Searching/Ranking. Crawling is a process of scanning web pages on the internet. Indexing collects data during crawling and is organized and stored in a database. Lastly, Searching/Ranking is when a user types in a query and the search engine searches the index, not the entire web, and how algorithms are used to determine the most relevant results for the users. As I was going through this activity, I was getting a visual representation of how the search engine is working behind the scenes. An interesting fact I learned is how search engines do not search the live web each time you enter a query; instead, they search through a pre-built index of the web, which is constantly updated by crawlers. This is how we see our results in an instant. Going through this activity helped me understand more about search engines and the algorithms used to filter and index our queries.

      The last activity I wanted to learn about was Understanding Applications:  IBM Technologyː AI vs. Machine Language. AI and Machine learning both go hand and hand with each other and are growing rapidly in today’s world. Artificial Intelligence is a system that can mimic human intelligence by performing tasks like thinking, reasoning, and learning. For example, ChatGPT, AI Bots, and Robotics. Machine learning, on the other hand, is like an algorithm that learns and makes predictions or decisions from data without being explicitly programmed. In the activity, I also got to learn about “Deep Learning”, which is a more advanced form of Machine learning that uses layered neural networks to analyze complex patterns, for example, voice and image recognition. Overall, the activity highlights how AI encompasses a wide range of intelligent behavior, while Machine learning is one of the core methods used to achieve it. If someone is a Software Engineer or works in tech, I highly recommend they jump on the AI and Machine Learning train as soon as possible. I am still deciding what field I should jump on to next whether that is Cloud Engineering or becoming an AI Engineer, using tools like Python to help me develop AI projects like an AI Chatbot or a Resume Critiquer. The future is bright for both AI and Machine Learning, but Machine Learning is difficult since it does require one to come from a math background.
