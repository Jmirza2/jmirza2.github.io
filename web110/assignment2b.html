      One of the activities I learned about was GCFLearnFree: Search Better. Search engines are essentially web-based tools used to find information on the internet. These search engines may be Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc, with Google being popular. The difference between different search engines is we get different results. For example, Google, the popular engine, usually provides more relevant results and organizes and filters those results better. What I learned during this activity was the different types of websites we might encounter when searching for information online. Each type serves a unique purpose and has strengths or weaknesses in terms of reliability, bias, and up to date content. For example, we have Commercial Sites, Organization Sites, Wiki, Blogs, and News Sites. Some new things I picked up on were different Cloud Bookmarkings such as Google Bookmarks, Diigo, and Instapaper. All offer different ways to bookmark, share, highlight, and comment on your bookmarks. Although I donâ€™t use the features I listed, I am excited to learn more about how search engines operate in the next activity. Especially how different search engines provide different search results.
