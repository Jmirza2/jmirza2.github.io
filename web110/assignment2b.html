      One of the activities I learned about was GCFLearnFree: Search Better. Search engines are essentially web-based tools used to find information on the internet. These search engines may be Google, Yahoo, Bing, etc, with Google being popular. The difference between different search engines is we get different results. For example, Google, the popular engine, usually provides more relevant results and organizes and filters those results better. What I learned during this activity was the different types of websites we might encounter when searching for information online. Each type serves a unique purpose and has strengths or weaknesses in terms of reliability, bias, and up to date content. For example, we have Commercial Sites, Organization Sites, Wiki, Blogs, and News Sites. Some new things I picked up on were different Cloud Bookmarkings such as Google Bookmarks, Diigo, and Instapaper. All offer different ways to bookmark, share, highlight, and comment on your bookmarks. Although I don’t use the features I listed, I am excited to learn more about how search engines operate in the next activity. Especially how different search engines provide different search results.

      The second activity I began reading about was TutorialsPoint: Search Engines. In this activity, we get the same explanation of a search engine with additional details on its components. What I learned about in this activity was the main functions of how search engines work. These are Crawling, Indexing, and Searching/Ranking. Crawling is a process of scanning web pages on the internet. Indexing collects data during crawling and is organized and stored in a database. Lastly, Searching/Ranking is when a user types in a query and the search engine searches the index, not the entire web, and how algorithms are used to determine the most relevant results for the users. As I was going through this activity, I was getting a visual representation of how the search engine is working behind the scenes. An interesting fact I learned is how search engines do not search the live web each time you enter a query; instead, they search through a pre-built index of the web, which is constantly updated by crawlers. This is how we see our results in an instant. Going through this activity helped me understand more about search engines and the algorithms used to filter and index our queries.
