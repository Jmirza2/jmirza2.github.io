One of the activities I learned about was Internet Basics: What is the Internet and how it operates. The Internet is a global network of computers that are all connected and can communicate with each other. It allows people from all over the globe to share information with each other, communicate, access websites, videos, and apps. The internet was first invented back in January 1st 1983. Its purpose at the time was used for scientific research and sharing information between researchers and universities. Along with the internet we have the Web (World Wide Web). The web is a collection of different websites we can access throughout the internet. Throughout the past forty years, the internet evolved in many ways such as Email used to send mail to each other via the internet, chatting and instant messaging with friends, family, or coworkers, social networking, watching media, online shopping, having your own business etc. There are more things I learned throughout this activity such as what is the Cloud? A cloud is pretty much the internet. It is used to store and access your data, apps, and services over the Internet instead of on your own local computer. All of your data essentially is stored in a cloud in a database. We also have Cloud Storage that can save and backup our data for example iCloud. This can be incredibly beneficial because it makes storing, accessing, and managing our data easier, safer, and more flexible. This activity inspired me to learn more about cloud computing and do more research on how cloud systems and architect work.

The second activity I began reading about was TutorialsPoint: Internet Technologies. Here I learned about what internet protocols are. Internet protocols are essentially rules or languages that computers use to communicate with each other on the Internet. It makes sure that the data is being sent correctly and reaches the right destination. A couple protocols I learned were IP and TCP (Transmission Control Protocol). IP is like a home address for computers. Every device on the Internet has an IP address which helps route the data to the right location. TCP makes sure the data being sent is reliably and in the correct order. Learning about IP's helped me better understand how data is reliably transmitted which can help me in the future troubleshoot connection issues, and verify API responses as a Software Engineer in my role.

The last activity I wanted to learn about was Understanding Applications. Applications are something we use everyday. They're known as programs or apps. We use applications to perform a certain task such as using the Netflix app to watch a movie or TV show, opening the Notes app to take notes, or opening an app to play a game. Apps can be installed from the internet, downloaded from an app store, or come pre installed on a device like your iPhone, Android, or computer. I have always wanted to build an application from scratch like a iOS weather app, or possibly an A.I app. Going through this activity helped me understand more about applications and how they're useful. Becoming a developer is one of my next steps to progress in my career and expand my skills in building real world applications that can solve most everyday problems.
