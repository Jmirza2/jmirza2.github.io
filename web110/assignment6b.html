        The image I created was originally supposed to be a character from an anime driving a Dodge Charger. 
        I used Adobe Firefly to generate my AI image and to my surprise it was really easy to use, navigate, and to
        generate my image. It was a very good idea using it in my project, and how easy it was to implement into my HTML.
