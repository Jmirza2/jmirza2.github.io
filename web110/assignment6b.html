        The image I created was originally supposed to be a character from an anime driving a Dodge Charger. 
        I used Adobe Firefly to generate my AI image and to my surprise it was really easy to use, navigate, and to
        generate my image. It was a very good idea using it in my project, and how easy it was to implement into my HTML.

    <p style= "color: black; font-size: 35px; font-family: Tahoma";> This lesson helped me understand how important web accessibility is for making sure everyone including people with disabilities can use and enjoy websites. I learned how tools like screen readers work, how alt text for images matters, and how color contrast impacts readability. I also got familiar with using tools like WAVE and the W3C Validators to check for accessibility issues. In the future, I’ll use what I’ve learned to build websites that are more inclusive and easier to use for everyone. What I learned will for sure help me in both school projects and in my personal projects.
