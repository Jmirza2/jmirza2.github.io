      One of the activities I learned about was GCF Global: Email Basics. During this activity, I got to learn about the introduction to email, as well as the different types of email providers and how email addresses are written. Email stands for Electronic mail. It is a great tool for digital communication that allows instant message delivery over the Internet. What I learned is that it plays a big role in both personal and professional life. These things can be emailing for your job, signing up for online services, or using email for organizing tasks. Understanding email is essential today because it’s the foundation for most online activities. I use email every day just like everybody else in today’s world, and I don’t think it will be going anywhere. It’s very useful for keeping track of information related to work, and online orders, and it takes up less storage than you think.

      My next activity, “TutorialsPoint: E-mail Overview,”  is a continuation of GCF Global: Email Basics. In this activity, I gained a deeper understanding of how emails function behind the scenes, specifically the protocols that make email communication possible. I learned that SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol), is used to send emails from a client to a server and between servers. POP3, (Post Office Protocol version 3), is a download-and-delete protocol where messages are fetched to your device and then removed from the server. IMAP, (Internet Message Access Protocol), allows multiple devices to access and manage the same mailbox while keeping messages stored on the server and organized in folders. I also learned about the flow of how email works: first, a message is composed using a Mail User Agent such as Gmail or Yahoo. When an email is sent, it is handed off to a Mail Transfer Agent via the SMTP protocol, which takes the message through the Internet. The MTA  then uses DNS to look up the recipient’s domain and identify the correct Mail Exchange server to complete the delivery. This was what caught my eye while working on this activity. In the future, I could apply this knowledge while working on projects that are related to emails, backend services, or integrations.

      The next activity I began reading about is Social Media, specifically on GCFLearnFree: Instagram. During this activity, I got to learn what Instagram is, and how anyone can use it. Instagram is a social media app that was released in 2010. It is essentially a photo and video-sharing social media mobile app, similar to Facebook where you can upload pictures, connect with friends and family, post stories, and message. The activity goes over how we navigate Instagram such as viewing our profile, editing our pictures, adding friends, etc. I use Instagram every day, and it is one of my favorite social media apps. I have been using it for over 10 years and I have seen this app go through a lot of major updates throughout the years. I plan on using Instagram for the foreseeable future.

      The last activity I began reading was LinkedIn Basics on GCFLearnFree. This activity provided an overview of what LinkedIn is and how to use it effectively.LinkedIn is a professional networking site, much similar to Facebook but tailored entirely towards your career. It's mainly used by job seekers, employers, and recruiters. I learned how LinkedIn helps users connect with professionals in their industry, join groups, and search for jobs. The lesson covered essential topics such as creating a LinkedIn account, understanding terminology like profile, connections, and endorsements, and navigating the user interface. Personally, I already use LinkedIn to stay connected with peers and to explore new job opportunities when needed. Given today’s competitive job market, the platform has become oversaturated with more people turning to LinkedIn during tough economic times. Overall, this activity was well structured, and learned the overall basics of LinkedIn. I would recommend it to anyone looking to understand or get started with LinkedIn for professional networking or job hunting.
