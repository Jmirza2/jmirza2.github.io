      One of the activities I learned about was GCF Global: Email Basics. During this activity, I got to learn about the introduction to email, as well as the different types of email providers and how email addresses are written. Email stands for Electronic mail. It is a great tool for digital communication that allows instant message delivery over the Internet. What I learned is that it plays a big role in both personal and professional life. These things can be emailing for your job, signing up for online services, or using email for organizing tasks. Understanding email is essential today because it’s the foundation for most online activities. I use email every day just like everybody else in today’s world, and I don’t think it will be going anywhere. It’s very useful for keeping track of information related to work, and online orders, and it takes up less storage than you think.
