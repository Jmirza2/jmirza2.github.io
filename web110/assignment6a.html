      During this assignment, I got to learn and understand how to implement iframe and img into HTML. Having plain text on your website is boring, but by adding in iframes or images, they bring life to your website and make it stand out a lot. I was having trouble trying to add a folder with my image, but after more research, I was successfully able to add an image to my website. I was also able to practice my skills trying to reposition where I would like my image to go. Iframe on the other hand, allows you to embed another website or youtube onto your page. For this assignment, I linked a youtube video on how to add iframes into HTML. This was a very helpful and useful assignment this week. I enjoy learning more about HTML. I want to continue to learn more new things such as adding cool animations, learning more about designs, and mastering the way to align text and change colors without the need of having to google it.
