      TutorialsPoint: Web Browser One of the activities I learned about was the TutorialsPoint: Web Browser. A Web Browser is an application which allows us to view and explore information across the internet. Most popular browsers we have nowadays are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. Most web browsers are built using a common structural desgin including a controller which can handle user input, and an interpreter, which processes HTML and scripts, and client programs that support protocols like HTTP & FTP. The article I was reading gave a brief demo and explained how to use Internet Explorer. For example entering a URL, navigating pages, and managing bookmarks. Web browsers are pretty much needed in order for us to visit the Internet. As I continued my research on Web Browsers, I am learning different benefits each web browser offers. With Brave, it offers an Ad free experience to the user (in most cases), Chrome is super fast and offers users to install Chrome Extensions, and lastly Opera allows users to customize their user interface and has its own native VPN. Overall, browsers are powerful tools that allow users to explore the internet, and understanding how they work helps explain differences in how websites appear across different platforms.
