      One of the activities I learned about was the TutorialsPoint: Web Browser. A Web Browser is an application that allows us to view and explore information across the internet. The most popular browsers we have nowadays are Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera, and Edge. Most web browsers are built using a common structural design including a controller which can handle user input, and an interpreter, which processes HTML and scripts, and client programs that support protocols like HTTP & FTP. The article I was reading gave a brief demo and explained how to use Internet Explorer. For example, entering a URL, navigating pages, and managing bookmarks. Web browsers are pretty much needed for us to visit the Internet. As I continued my research on Web Browsers, I am learning the different benefits each web browser offers. With Brave, it offers an Ad-free experience to the user (in most cases), Chrome is super fast and allows users to install Chrome Extensions, and lastly, Opera allows users to customize their user interface and has its own native VPN. Overall, browsers are powerful tools that allow users to explore the internet, and understanding how they work helps explain differences in how websites appear across different platforms. After this activity, I can apply these concepts in my current life by using different browsers to compare how websites perform and look, especially if something isn’t loading right. I want to start using Brave more with its Ad free experience.

      The second activity I began reading about was "GCFLearnFree: Internet Tips". During this activity, I got to learn more about web browsers, URLs, and hyperlinks. I discovered how hyperlinks work, which shows how links work, how to recognize them visually, and how they enhance navigation.  I also gained a deeper understanding of URLs, including how they’re broken down into parts like the scheme (http/https), domain, path, parameters, and anchors. And lastly, I got to learn more about Web browsers such as if Adobe Flash is still necessary, how to clear cookies and cache, and using the browser's status bar. Overall, there was a lot of new information I learned and some information I refreshed my knowledge on. I plan on continuing to learn more about URLs because they do play a big role when it comes to API and automation testing from my work background.

      The last activity I explored was installing the Brave Web Browser. I am impressed with how user-friendly and great features Brave offers. The installation was very quick and easy. What I noticed while using the browser, was how fast and responsive it was while surfing the web. Not having Ads displayed on websites is a big plus for Brave. One feature I did notice was the ability to block cookies. Blocking cookies will not allow ads to be tailored or personalized to our needs. Another cool feature Brave offers is its own Leo A.I integrated it into the browser. These were some of the key features I picked up while exploring Brave. I do intend on using Brave more since seeing Ads does get annoying when I am using Google.
