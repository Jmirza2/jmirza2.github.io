        What I learned throughout this course and project, was the fundamental skills of building my own HTML and CSS Webpage from scratch.
        I learned how to structure content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images. I learned the differences between Inline, Internal, and external. 
        I also learned how to give style and desgin to my pages using CSS, for example colors, fonts, paddings, and margins.
