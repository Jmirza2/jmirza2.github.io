    <h1> Welcome to Joe's Final Project </h1>
    <h2 style="color: black; font-family: 'Courier New'; font-size: 45px;"> 
        What I learned throughout this course & project was the fundamental skills of building my own HTML and CSS Webpage.
        I learned how to structure content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
        I also learned how to give style and design to my pages using CSS, for example colors, fonts, padding, and margins.
