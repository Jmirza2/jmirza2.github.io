            What I learned throughout this course and project was the fundamental skills of building my own HTML and CSS webpage from scratch.
            I got hands on experience structuring content using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, and images.
            I also learned the differences between inline, internal, and external CSS, and how each one is used to apply styles.
            In addition, I explored how to enhance the appereance of a webpage using CSS properties such as colors, fonts. paddings, and margins.
            This course gave me a strong foundation in front end web development that I can build on in future projects or future careers.
