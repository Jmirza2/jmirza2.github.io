    <h1>Assignment 5a</h1>
    <p> One of the activities I learned about was W3Schools: Introduction to HTML. HTML stands for HyperText Transfer Protocol. HTML is a structure or a skeleton used to develop a web page. Throughout this activity I learned about what HTML is, how we use it, and how it works. You start to understand what tag names and elements are, and how they’re used in HTML in order for you to begin creating your website. These tag names may be “HTML” which is the root,("<h>") for the heading, and used ("<p>"") for writing paragraphs. I also got to see how the visualization of HTML is structured on a website, for example where your title will be placed, body, and paragraph. HTML has to be by far one of my favorite activities researched in class. I began learning about web development in HTML and CSS about two weeks ago and it is really awesome to learn. I do hope to continue learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build websites and possibly become a developer if I want to. </p>
