            For my final project, I want to demonstrate how to create a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
            I plan to record and upload a live YouTube tutorial video where I walk through the process step by step. 
            In the video, I will showcase how to add text elements such as headers, h1,  and paragraphs, as well as how to style them using CSS, including adding colors and other basic design elements. 
            I will also explain the structure of an HTML document and how CSS works alongside HTML to enhance the appearance of a webpage. This project will help others learn the fundamentals of web development in a simple and engaging way.

        What I learned during this project was I got a deeper understanding of how HTML and CSS work together to structure and style a webpage. 
        I learned how to use HTML to organize content with tags like headings, paragraphs, and image elements, and how to enhance the visual appearance using CSS for layout, 
        colors, fonts, and spacing.I can apply this knowledge in real life by building my own personal websites or small business sites, and it also gives me a strong foundation 
        for future roles in web development. I have been watching videos, I have been learning cool things I can do with CSS while designing my HTML web page.
