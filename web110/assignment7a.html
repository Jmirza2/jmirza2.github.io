            For my final project, I want to demonstrate how to create a website from scratch using HTML and CSS.
            I plan to record and upload a live YouTube tutorial video where I walk through the process step by step. 
            In the video, I will showcase how to add text elements such as headers, h1,  and paragraphs, as well as how to style them using CSS, including adding colors and other basic design elements. 
            I will also explain the structure of an HTML document and how CSS works alongside HTML to enhance the appearance of a webpage. This project will help others learn the fundamentals of web development in a simple and engaging way.
