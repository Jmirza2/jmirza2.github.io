            During this lesson, I learned the basics of SQL by going through this activity: 
            https://www.w3schools.com/sql/. I learned how databases are used to store, retrieve, and 
            update information. I practiced essential SQL commands like SELECT, WHERE, COUNT, INSERT 
            INTO, and UPDATE, which are used to interact with data in meaningful ways. 
            Understanding how queries work helps me see how websites and apps handle user data behind 
            the scenes. Learning about databases is valuable for any tech related career, especially 
            in web development, QA, or data analysis. I look forward to taking my Introduction to 
            Databases in the fall as it will help me dive deep into SQL, in which I can use at my job
             or any future opportunity.
