One of the activities I learned about was Internet Basics: What is the Internet and how it operates. The Internet is a global network of computers that are all connected and can communicate with each other. It allows people from all over the globe to share information with each other, communicate, access websites, videos, and apps. The internet was first invented back in January 1st 1983. Its purpose at the time was used for scientific research and sharing information between researchers and universities. Along with the internet we have the Web (World Wide Web). The web is a collection of different websites we can access throughout the internet. Throughout the past forty years, the internet evolved in many ways such as Email used to send mail to each other via the internet, chatting and instant messaging with friends, family, or coworkers, social networking, watching media, online shopping, having your own business etc. There are more things I learned throughout this activity such as what is the Cloud? A cloud is pretty much the internet. It is used to store and access your data, apps, and services over the Internet instead of on your own local computer. All of your data essentially is stored in a cloud in a database. We also have Cloud Storage that can save and backup our data for example iCloud. This can be incredibly beneficial because it makes storing, accessing, and managing our data easier, safer, and more flexible. This activity inspired me to learn more about cloud computing and possibly pursue my interest in becoming a cloud engineer.

The second activity I began reading about was Javascript. Javascript is crazy popular in today's world. The main difference between Javascript and Java is Javascript is a scripting language used to give instructions to a software in apps and websites and run Javascript code in browsers only, whereas Java is a high level object oriented programming language which can be used to create applications and run them both on virtual machines and browsers. JavaScript was first introduced in 1995, and since then, it has steadily grown in popularity among web developers. Web development is mainly one of the reasons why Javascript was publicly known for. You can use Javascript with HTML and CSS to develop and design your own website. Learning all three can be challenging but it is a fun experience to say the least. What's cool about Javascript being popular, is it can be used with various different tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, React, Typescript, or Playwright. I am interested in one day learning Javascript just because it is way easier to pick up since I do come from a Java background, and applying my skills to become a front end developer.

The last activity I wanted to learn about was HTML. HTML was first introduced in 1993. HTML stands for “Hyper text markup language”. It is code used to structure a web page and its content inside. HTML is used for creating web documents on the internet. For example, you can design, add graphics, change fonts, or maintain frames and windows. You save it in a text file which will allow any browser to read that file. You can think of HTML as a skeleton or a structure for a website. Followed by Javascript for the logic or brain, and CSS for more styling of a website. I do intend on learning HTML in the future if I want to become a front end developer. I am familiar with the HTML DOM in my job, since I do retrieve web elements needed from the HTML DOM to complete my testing.
