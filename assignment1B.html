One of the activities I learned about was Databases. Databases are essentially ways to store large groups of user's data. We can use databases to store, maintain, and access data. The things we can store in databases can be information of people such as their personal information, records, pictures and videos like in social media. What caught my attention while reading about the history of databases was back then, index cards were used for large storage. There are many different types of databases such as Flat Files, Relational, and Non-relational. Databases allow us to store, manage, and be able to retrieve data. When working with databases we will use the CRUD method. Create, Read, Update, and Delete. These are the fundamentals used for managing data inside databases. Databases are used almost everywhere by many industries such as E-Commerce, Manufacturing, Banking, Healthcare, Supply chains etc. As for SQL, SQL stands for Structured Query Language and is used to manage relational databases. SQL is very popular in companies and in tech nowadays. Fun fact, SQL can also be interpreted as a programming language. I will be taking intro to Databases next semester which I am personally excited about. I am excited to learn of relational & non-relational databases as well as learning SQL, Oracle, and AWS databases. I have used SQL years ago and many companies do have SQL & NoSQL listed in their job description. It is an excellent skill I want to pick up and perhaps one day, be able to apply my SQL skills in a future role.

The second activity I began reading about was Javascript. Javascript is crazy popular in today's world. The main difference between Javascript and Java is Javascript is a scripting language used to give instructions to a software in apps and websites and run Javascript code in browsers only, whereas Java is a high level object oriented programming language which can be used to create applications and run them both on virtual machines and browsers. JavaScript was first introduced in 1995, and since then, it has steadily grown in popularity among web developers. Web development is mainly one of the reasons why Javascript was publicly known for. You can use Javascript with HTML and CSS to develop and design your own website. Learning all three can be challenging but it is a fun experience to say the least. What's cool about Javascript being popular, is it can be used with various different tools and technologies such as HTML, CSS, React, Typescript, or Playwright. I am interested in one day learning Javascript just because it is way easier to pick up since I do come from a Java background, and applying my skills to become a front end developer.

The last activity I wanted to learn about was HTML. HTML was first introduced in 1993. HTML stands for “Hyper text markup language”. It is code used to structure a web page and its content inside. HTML is used for creating web documents on the internet. For example, you can design, add graphics, change fonts, or maintain frames and windows. You save it in a text file which will allow any browser to read that file. You can think of HTML as a skeleton or a structure for a website. Followed by Javascript for the logic or brain, and CSS for more styling of a website. I do intend on learning HTML in the future if I want to become a front end developer. I am familiar with the HTML DOM in my job, since I do retrieve web elements needed from the HTML DOM to complete my testing.
